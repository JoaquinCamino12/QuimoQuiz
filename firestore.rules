 * @description This ruleset governs access to the global question database for the Quimo-Quiz app. It allows public read access to all questions and restricts write access.

 * @keySecurityDecisions All questions are publicly readable to support the quiz functionality. Write operations are completely disabled to prevent unauthorized modification of the question bank. There is no user-specific data or authorization context in this design, questions are global and public.
